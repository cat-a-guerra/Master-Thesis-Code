% ----------------------- Initial dip HRF model --------------------------

% Here, we manually create an initial dip according to the canonical HRF we
% previously designed and then we insert it the original HRF. I know it is 
% not the most elegant solution, but at the time it was the only one I 
% could see working. 

% The initial dip resembles to a positive quadratic function shape. Thus,
% to manually create an initial dip, we get the coefficients of a quadratic 
% function which could fit well into our original HRF. 
% According to the shape of our original HRF, we would like to plot a
% positive quadratic function between 0 and 2.1 s, with a vortex at 0.9 s.
% Hence, by using the quadratic function equation (a*x^2 + b*x + c = 0) 
% and the parabola vortex formula (h = -b/(2*a)), and considering the 
% intended requirements, we implemented the following linear equation
% system to solve a, b and c (given we know the x's):

    % equation 1 ==> a*(0^2) + b*0 + c = f(0)
    % equation 2 ==> a*(2.1^2) + b*2.1 + c = f(2.1)
    % equation 3 ==> a*(2*0.9) + b + 0*c = 0 --> from the parabola vortex
% formula: h=0.9, and therefore, 0.9 = -b/(2*a) <==> (2*0.9)*a + b = 0

% Solving the linear equation system
syms a b c
eq1 = a*(time(1)^2) + b*time(1) + c == hrf(1);
eq2 = a*(time(22)^2) + b*time(22) + c == hrf(22);
eq3 = a*(2*0.9) + 1*b + 0 == 0;
[A,B] = equationsToMatrix([eq1, eq2, eq3], [a, b, c]);                              % A - coeficients of a,b,c; B - 2nd term of the equation
